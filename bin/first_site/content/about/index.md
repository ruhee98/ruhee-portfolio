{{<imgabout name="portrait.jpg" alt="about" caption="Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ruhee and I am an aspiring front end developer originally from Nepal. I am interested in research, data analytics and combining cutting edge new technologies to solve social, economic context problems. Iâ€™m currently working on a data analytics music project using Python that integrates Spotify Web API for generating my dataset, and analysing personal music trends based on usersâ€™ playlists for data visualisation. I'm currently learning Python for data analytics, and am interested in implementing Data visualisation tools from Python Library; also curious about exploring React's GraphQL, D3.js, and other libraries.">}}
